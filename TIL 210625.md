### Controlled Component? Uncontrolled Component?

> Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input of type password to be controlled. Input elements should not switch from uncontrolled to controlled (or vice versa). Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component.

[공식 문서](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with [`setState()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
