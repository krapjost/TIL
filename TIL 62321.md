### 사용자의 개인 정보는 브라우저 어디에 보관해야 할까?

1. 로컬 스토리지는 동기식이라 자바스크립트 쓰레드를 막을 수 있다. 꼭 필요한 경우 아니면 안 쓰는 것 추천.
2. 데이터를 보관하지 않아도 되는 경우는 보관하지 말라 ( 암호화는 마지막 선택지 )

#### sessionStorage

> SessionStorage object is used to store data on a temporary basis and cleared when the page session ends. Since SessionStorage is tab specific, it is not accessible from web workers or service workers. It is limited to about 5 MB and can contain only strings. It may be useful for storing small amounts of session specific information, for example, IndexedDB key.

#### localStorage

> LocalStorage object is used to store data for the entire website on a permanent basis. LocalStorage is not accessible from web workers or service workers. It is limited to about 5MB and can contain only strings. LocalStorage should be avoided because it is synchronous and will block the main thread.

#### cookies

> Cookies are sent with every HTTP request, so storing data in it will significantly increase the size of web requests. They are synchronous, and are not accessible from web workers. Like LocalStorage and SessionStorage, cookies are limited to only strings. Cookies have their uses, but not a good choice for storage.

#### webSQL

> WebSQL Support has been removed from almost all major browsers. The W3C stopped maintaining the Web SQL spec in 2010, with no plans to further updates planned. WebSQL should not be used, and existing usage should be migrated to IndexedDB.

#### cache

> Cache has been deprecated and support will be removed from browsers in the future. Application cache should not be used, and existing usage should be migrated to service workers and the Cache API.

#### indexedDB

> Unlike most modern promise-based APIs, IndexedDB is event based. Promise wrappers like idb for IndexedDB hide some of the powerful features but more importantly, hide the complex machinery (e.g. transactions, schema versioning) that comes with the IndexedDB library. It is a low level API that requires significant setup before use, which can be particularly painful for storing simple data.
